# modos-api

Access and manage Multi-Omics Digital Objects (MODOs).

## Context

### Goals

Provide a digital object and system to process, store and serve multi-omics data with their metadata such that:

- Traceability and reproducibility is ensured by rich metadata
- The different omics layers are processed and distributed together
- Common operations such as liftover can be automated easily and ensure that omics layers are kept in sync
- Data can be accessed, sliced and streamed over the network without downloading the dataset.

### Architecture

The client library by itself can be used to work with local MODOs, or connect to a server to access objects over s3.

The server configuration and setup insructions can be found in [deploy](deploy). It consists of a REST API, an s3 server and an htsget server to stream CRAM/BCF over the network. The aim is to provide transparent remote access to MODOs without storing the data locally.

### Format

The digital object is composed of a folder with:

- Genomic data files (CRAM, BCF, ...)
- A zarr archive for metadata and array-based data

The metadata links to the different files and provides context using the [modos-schema](https://sdsc-ordes.github.io/modos-schema).

## Installation

The library can be installed with pip:
```sh
pip install modos
```

The development version can be installed directly from github:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/modos-api.git@main
```

## Usage

The CLI is convenient for quickly managing modos (creation, edition, deletion) and quick inspections:

```sh
$ # remote example
$ modos --endpoint http://localhost show --zarr s3://ex-bucket/ex-modo
/
 ├── assay
 │   └── assay1
 ├── data
 │   ├── calls1
 │   └── demo1
 ├── reference
 │   └── reference1
 └── sample
     └── sample1

$ # local example
$ modos show --files data/ex
data/ex/reference1.fa.fai
data/ex/demo1.cram
data/ex/reference1.fa
data/ex/calls1.bcf
data/ex/demo1.cram.crai
data/ex/calls1.bcf.csi
```

The user facing API is in `modos.api`. It provides full programmatic access to the object's [meta]data:

```python
>>> from modos.api import MODO

>>> ex = MODO('./example-digital-object')
>>> ex.list_samples()
['sample/sample1']
>>> ex.metadata["data/calls1"]
{'@type': 'DataEntity',
 'data_format': 'BCF',
 'data_path': 'calls1.bcf',
 'description': 'variant calls for tests',
 'has_reference': ['reference/reference1'],
 'has_sample': ['sample/sample1'],
 'name': 'Calls 1'}
>>> rec = next(ex.stream_genomics("calls1.bcf", "chr1:103-1321"))
>>> rec.alleles
('A', 'C')
```

For advanced use cases, the object's metadata can be queried with SPARQL!
```python
>>> # Build a table with all files from male samples
>>> query = """
...   SELECT ?assay ?sample ?file
...   WHERE {
...     [] schema:name ?assay ;
...       modos:has_data [
...         modos:data_path ?file ;
...         modos:has_sample [
...           schema:name ?sample ;
...           modos:sex ?sex
...         ]
...       ] .
...     FILTER(?sex = "Male")
...   }
... """
>>> ex.query(query).serialize(format="csv").decode())
assay,sample,file
Assay 1,Sample 1,file://ex/calls1.bcf
Assay 1,Sample 1,file://ex/demo1.cram
```

## Acknowledgements and Funding

The development of the Multi-Omics Digital Object System (MODOS) is being funded by the Personalized Health Data Analysis Hub, a joint initiative of the Personalized Health and Related Technologies ([PHRT](https://www.sfa-phrt.ch)) and the Swiss Data Science Center ([SDSC](https://datascience.ch)), for a period of three years from 2023 to 2025. The SDSC leads the development of MODOS, bringing expertise in complex data structures associated with multi-omics and imaging data to advance privacy-centric clinical-grade integration. The PHRT contributes its domain expertise of the Swiss Multi-Omics Center ([SMOC](http://smoc.ethz.ch)) in the generation, analysis, and interpretation of multi-omics data for personalized health and precision medicine applications.
We gratefully acknowledge the [Health 2030 Genome Center](https://www.health2030genome.ch/) for their substantial contributions to the development of MODOS by providing test data sets, deployment infrastructure, and expertise.
